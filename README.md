<p>One thing that has a big impact in my life is the people that surround me. My closest friends are people that share their wisdom and experiences with me and straight me up when needed. What I am saying is that because of the poplin my life, I desire to do better; better than what is expected of me; give more of myself, dream, &amp; dream big...knowing that this comes after overcoming hardships, struggles, that at the end it is worthy. </p>

<p><em>What I have done so far about programming are:</em> signing up for free intro coding classes and buying a new required laptop. The class will give me the tools to go in knowing the lingo in this career. The laptop is a huge financial investment but I do see the big picture and at the end, the sacrifice will pay off. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>My professional goals in two and five years are:</em> to find a stable good company that shares similar values as I with opportunities to continuing growing within. I am a very loyal person but I also like to be appreciated. I enjoy contributing with projects, innovating, being part of something bigger than myself. A place that is not only a good place to work but that also embraces values such as good work ethics, respect, honesty, integrity, and family-oriented. Another element that is vital for me is to have a place that has a purpose (that care for others in need). </p></li>
<li><p><em>It is not so much a mistake...</em>but sometimes I wish that I knew as much as I know now earlier in life. But then, I believe everything has a purpose and there is a process. And that is what takes time. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>For instance, I now experience confidence and have a strong sense of my value as a person. I now know what i want, I take care of myself, and invest in me. Where as before, a good picture description is that "I went where the wind blew." I used to care about what others thought. </p>

<p>Since little I knew I wanted to be more than what was expected of me was a woman in my culture (finish middle school and then get ready for marriage). I was born and raised in Mexico. My family and I migrated to the USA in May, 2002. My parents worked in the fields since their youth and would go visit as they could. My paternal grandparents took care of us. </p>

<p>By 2002, when my siblings and I came with my parents for the first time, we worked in the fields to help out picking:</p>

<p>-cherries
 -peaches
 -sweet potatoes, etc. </p>

<p>But since I wanted to study I attended school full-time and worked full-time most of the time all the way through University starting again with the abc's in English. </p>

<p>I remember that my aspiration after entering the U.S. was to be at least a cleaner at a hospital...</p>

<p>I wish sometimes that I had someone that supported me to go against the culture, someone that showed me to dream...The way I found this path was by walking through the hard way (worked in canneries, grave yard shifts, picking trash, etc.). </p>

<p>All this, now makes me appreciate more life, people, and to not mind the meaningless things in life. It made me who I am today (strong, intelligent, confident, kind, generous, etc.). </p>

<p><em>But if it was possible to go back, what I would do differently:</em> There are things that I would had liked to enjoy more and have more time for such as school, socializing, family, and more fun. </p>

<ol>
<li><em>I have thought myself English.</em> I learned it as a second language. The way I approach it was by being my main focused. There were distractions (people laughing and mocking) and no encouragement or support. </li>
</ol>

<p>I changed everything to English:</p>

<p>-socialize with English speaking people
-went to English speaking places
-what listened to
-what I watched
-what I read</p>

<p>I spoke up for myself. There were Spanish speaking individuals that wanted to "help" me by talking for me. I talked even more even with my broken English. It had to be me and that was the only way to practice. </p>
